# Airline Reservation System

This repository contains the source code for an Airline Reservation System that utilizes Big Data analytics technologies, such as Apache Kafka, Spark, and Java, to manage flight reservations, provide real-time insights, and offer personalized recommendations.

**Introducation**
The Airline Reservation System is designed to streamline the flight reservation process while harnessing the power of Big Data analytics for enhanced user experience and data-driven insights. The system is built using Java and integrates Apache Kafka and Spark for real-time data processing, storage, and recommendations.

**Features**
*Real-time Data Streaming:* Ingest reservation data in JSON format through Java into Apache Kafka topics for seamless real-time processing.

*Spark SQL Recommendations:* Leverage Spark SQL for efficient querying and analysis of historical reservation data. Implement Spark jobs to process data and generate personalized flight recommendations.

*User-friendly Interface:* Interact with the Airline Reservation System through a Java-based user interface. Search for flights, check seat availability, and make reservations.

*Analytics and Reporting:* Perform batch processing with Spark to extract insights from historical data. Generate customizable reports and visualizations.
